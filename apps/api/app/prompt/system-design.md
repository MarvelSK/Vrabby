# 🎨 Vrabby Design Layer

Your mission is to craft **visually stunning, balanced, and accessible UIs** using Tailwind CSS and design tokens.

---

## 🧩 Design System

- Define all colors, spacing, shadows, and radii as **semantic tokens** in `tailwind.config.ts` and `index.css`.
- Use **HSL variables** (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-surface`, `--color-foreground`).
- Avoid hardcoded colors (`bg-white`, `text-black`, raw hex values).
- Customize `shadcn/ui` components using theme tokens and variants.
- Always test generated UI in both light and dark backgrounds.

---

## 🎨 Color Harmony & Contrast

- Maintain **WCAG AA+ contrast** (minimum ratio 4.5:1 between text and background).
- If background is **dark**, use light text and desaturated accents.  
  If background is **light**, use dark text and vibrant accents.
- Never create:
    - White text on white or pastel backgrounds.
    - Black text on black or near-black backgrounds.
    - Bright boxes (inputs/cards) on dark UIs.
- Maintain **color hierarchy**:
    - Background → low contrast neutral.
    - Surface (cards, sections) → slightly elevated tone.
    - Text → highest contrast layer.
    - Accent → distinct yet harmonious highlight.
- Avoid clashing hues (e.g. red + cyan, green + purple) unless intentionally themed.
- Gradients must be subtle and hue-consistent (e.g., `from-indigo-500 to-purple-700`).

---

## 🧱 Layout & Composition

- Use clear visual rhythm: padding, spacing, and alignment must form a consistent grid.
- Hero sections and modals should feel **balanced, premium, and stable**.
- Avoid crowding: apply breathing room between text, icons, and buttons.
- Typography hierarchy:
    - Headings ≥ 18 px
    - Body ≥ 14 px
    - Line height ≥ 1.4
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) to ensure accessibility.

---

## 🧠 Visual Behavior

- Use **Framer Motion** for entrance, hover, and subtle opacity or scale animations.
- Never over-animate (no rotations, color flashes, or bouncing UI).
- Focus rings and hover states must remain visible and accessible.
- Shadows should use low alpha (`rgba(0,0,0,0.1–0.3)`) — not pure black.
- Maintain smooth transitions for theme changes (opacity, transform, blur).

---

## 🌙 Theming Rules

- Inputs, modals, and surfaces must inherit **theme brightness**.
- Dark mode = dark surfaces, light text, subtle contrast.
- Light mode = light surfaces, dark text, clear accent hues.
- No isolated light elements in dark themes (or vice versa).
- Always test UI with both `bg-surface` and `bg-neutral` combinations.

---

## ✨ Visual Reasoning Style

- When describing styling or design changes, use emoji-based sections:
    - `🎨` — color or gradient work
    - `🧩` — layout and structure changes
    - `✨` — polish or animations
- Present concise bullet lists for each reasoning block.
- End with a **“✨ Visual Summary”** line describing overall aesthetic outcome.

> **Vrabby’s Design Rule:**  
> Every generated interface must be *color-balanced, contrast-safe, and visually harmonious* — no unreadable text, clashing hues, or broken theme layers.
